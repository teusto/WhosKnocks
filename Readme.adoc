= SPEC-001: Blockchain-Based Identity and Access Card with Zero-Knowledge Proofs
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

This project aims to create a digital identity and access card application, leveraging blockchain and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technologies to provide users with a secure and privacy-preserving method of identity verification and access management. The card serves not only as an identity verifier but also as a dynamic access control provider that can be trusted across organizations and services.

The application will include a “smart business card” feature, enabling holders to share limited personal information such as their name, phone number, and calendar availability. The digital identity card will feature a QR code, compatible with wallet apps such as Apple Wallet, to simplify access and integration. Blockchain technology will ensure immutable and secure verification of identity attributes, while ZKPs will be used to verify permissions without revealing sensitive information.

== Requirements

=== Must-Have

* **Secure Identity Verification**: Implement blockchain-based identity management to ensure the integrity and immutability of user identities.
* **Access Permission Levels**: Support both predefined roles (e.g., Admin, Employee, Visitor) and dynamic, attribute-based access control.
* **Zero-Knowledge Proof for Privacy**: Use ZKP to validate user permissions and identity attributes without disclosing sensitive information.
* **QR Code Integration**: Generate a QR code that can be stored in wallet apps like Apple Wallet, linking to the user’s identity and access permissions.
* **Cross-Organization Compatibility**: Design the solution to support integration with multiple organizations or services as a trusted identity provider.

=== Should-Have

* **User Information Sharing**: Include personal data fields such as name, phone number, and calendar availability for business card purposes.
* **Revocation Mechanism**: Provide a way to revoke or update permissions and identity details if necessary, such as when a user’s role changes.

=== Could-Have

* **Multi-Signature Verification**: Allow multi-signature-based approvals for certain high-level access permissions.
* **Analytics on Access Patterns**: Gather anonymized access statistics for insights on usage trends across different organizations.
