= Blockchain-based Identity and Access Control PWA with Zero-Knowledge Proofs
:toc:

== Project Overview

This project is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built to demonstrate secure, privacy-focused identity verification and role-based access control using blockchain and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). The solution provides an identity card with role-based access permissions that can be added to wallet apps (e.g., Apple Wallet) and includes a QR code for quick verification.

== Features

* **User Registration**: Users can register with a unique identity and role (e.g., Employee, Admin).
* **Role-Based Access Control**: Different access levels are enforced based on user roles.
* **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Privacy-preserving verification using ZKPs for access without exposing user details.
* **QR Code Integration**: Each user has a unique QR code for identity verification.
* **PWA for Cross-Platform Accessibility**: The app can be installed on both mobile and desktop devices.
* **Blockchain Immutability**: Smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain ensure secure and verifiable identity management.

== Tech Stack

=== Frontend (PWA)
* **React with Vite**: Provides a fast, responsive, and modern development experience.
* **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and maintainable code.
* **Mantine UI**: A component library with theming and responsive design for a professional UI.
* **Cypress**: E2E testing to verify seamless user interactions across components.
* **Vite PWA Plugin**: Adds PWA capabilities, including offline access and installability.

=== Backend
* **Node.js & Express**: REST API to manage identity registration, role verification, and proof generation.
* **Ethers.js**: Interacts with Ethereum smart contracts for secure identity verification.
* **Circom & SnarkJS**: Generates and verifies zero-knowledge proofs, enabling role-based access control without revealing user data.
* **Jest**: Used for testing API endpoints and smart contract functions.

=== Smart Contracts
* **Foundry & Solidity**: Foundry is used to build and test smart contracts that manage identities, roles, and permissions on the Ethereum blockchain.
* **Anvil**: A local Ethereum node provided by Foundry for fast smart contract testing.

== Project Structure

* `apps/frontend`: Contains the React PWA with components, pages, and API service integration.
* `apps/backend`: Contains the Node.js backend with API endpoints for identity registration, access verification, and ZKP handling.
* `packages/smart-contracts`: Foundry-based smart contracts written in Solidity, managing user identities and roles.

== Future Improvements

* **Multi-signature Verification**: Enable multi-signature access approvals for enhanced security.
* **Revocation Mechanism**: Add role and permission revocation for dynamic access management.
* **Analytics Dashboard**: Implement a dashboard to visualize user access patterns.
