== Method

This project will be structured as a distributed, modular application using blockchain for identity verification, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) for privacy-preserving access control, and a mobile-friendly frontend for user interaction. Below are the key architectural components and technologies to be used.

=== Architecture Overview

The proposed architecture is divided into the following main components:

1. **Identity Management System**: A blockchain-based identity management service to create, store, and verify user identities.
2. **Access Control Layer with ZKP**: A module that uses ZKPs to confirm user access permissions without exposing sensitive details.
3. **User Interface (UI)**: A mobile-responsive frontend with QR code integration for wallet compatibility and displaying user information.
4. **Business Card Feature**: A digital business card layer that allows the sharing of personal data with dynamic privacy controls.

### Component Details

1. **Identity Management System**: This component leverages blockchain smart contracts to securely register and validate users' identities. Smart contracts will store hashed versions of user attributes (e.g., name, phone number) and link to permissions data. The ledger ensures data immutability and transparency.

2. **Access Control Layer with ZKP**: Using ZKPs, this layer verifies permissions without revealing details. For example, ZK-SNARKs or zk-STARKs could confirm whether a user has the necessary attributes (e.g., “Employee”) without revealing exact roles. This allows selective access control that can be validated off-chain, improving privacy and performance.

3. **User Interface (UI)**: A React Native or Flutter-based UI will support iOS and Android, with QR code generation for adding the card to wallet apps like Apple Wallet. The UI will also enable users to display and share their business card info in a controlled manner.

4. **Business Card Feature**: This feature enables users to share only specified details with others. For example, users can choose to reveal their name and phone number but not their availability unless explicitly permitted. Blockchain links the ZKP of these permissions to the identity, ensuring users retain control.

=== Technology Stack Options

Below are suggested tech stack options to cover blockchain, ZKP, frontend, and backend needs. Each choice is suitable for a portfolio-quality project:

**1. Blockchain Platform:**
   * **Ethereum** (with Solidity for smart contracts): Good for showcasing work due to high industry demand and support.
   * **Polygon**: Built on Ethereum, it offers better performance with lower costs, ideal for high-frequency operations like identity verification.
   * **Hyperledger Fabric** (for permissioned networks): Excellent for enterprise integration, though less popular for public identity verification.

**2. Zero-Knowledge Proof Libraries:**
   * **zk-SNARKs (ZoKrates)**: Integrates well with Ethereum-based platforms, enabling the creation of ZKPs on Solidity smart contracts.
   * **zk-STARKs**: Scalable and transparent; offers better performance for large datasets but is still emerging in terms of developer tools.
   * **Circom & SnarkJS**: A highly accessible ZKP toolchain for creating customized proofs and verifying them in Solidity or JavaScript.

**3. Backend Services:**
   * **Node.js with Express**: Offers a flexible and performant solution for building APIs to interact with the blockchain.
   * **GraphQL** (optional): For more advanced querying capabilities, especially if the application will grow to support more features or integrate with multiple organizations.
   * **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**: Use IPFS for off-chain data storage, such as user profile images or large metadata, ensuring data is decentralized.

**4. Frontend and QR Code Integration:**
   * **React Native**: Ideal for a portfolio, React Native is popular and versatile for developing both iOS and Android apps, and supports wallet API integrations.
   * **Flutter**: Another good choice if you want to demonstrate skill in cross-platform development with a single codebase.
   * **QR Code Generation Libraries**: For QR codes, libraries like `qrcode.react` (for React) or `qr_flutter` (for Flutter) are reliable options for generating QR codes that link to user profiles.
